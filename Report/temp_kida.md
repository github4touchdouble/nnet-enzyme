Following are the sections that get into detail about the architecture and working of each neural network model based on 
the detailed code you provided, extracting and elaborating nuances and characteristics of your implementations.

# 7 Binary FNN Model

This model introduces an architecture of four densely connected layers, aimed for a binary classification problem of enzyme classes. 
The first layer gives the input and expands it to 1760 units, next 1000, 500 and then finally to 1 unit.
Each of these layers uses the ReLU activation function that is commonly known for its ability to perform non-linear transformations and solution to the vanishing gradient.
The final output will be passed through a Sigmoid activation function which fits well into binary classification due to the fact that it squashes any real-valued number into the value between 0 and 1.

In terms of performance, the model exhibits varied performances in between embeddings, a strong indicator that although the architecture is static across different embeddings, it reacts differently to the distinct features of each embedding.
This makes customisation of the architecture so that it is better aligned to the characteristics of each particular embedding an area that has room for further improvement.
Moreover, regularization techniques like dropout can be used to mitigate the overfitting problem experienced in networks of this nature.

# FNN Model for Multiclass Classification

The multiclass FNN model, developed for both ESM2 and PROTT5 embeddings involves a sequential arrangement of linear layers with each accompanied by LeakyReLU activation functions.
This choice of activation function, LeakyReLU is particularly remarkable for the capability it presents of dealing with “dying ReLU” TODO: Quelle?
problem by allowing a small gradient when the unit is not active. 
For ESM2 embeddings, the architecture of the model consist of layers sized at 1024, 1024, 512, and finally 7 units, the later being correspondent 
to the number of enzyme main classes. In contrast, the size of the layers in the PROTT5-based model architecture is 1024, 768, 256, and 7.
It is worth pointing out that both architectures contain BatchNorm1d layers intended for normalizing the input layer through adjustment
and scaling activations to thereby set 
forth stabilization of both the training process and accelerate them as well.

Model prefers Softmax function in the final layer for both ESM2 and PROTT5 embeddings, NOTE: Ich glaube das ist klar, dass wir bei Multiclass softmax benutzen 
appropriate for multiclass classification as it squashes the output to a probability distribution over predicted output classes.
Model Architecture Design encapsulates a well-thought-out approach keeping in view the intricate structure and dependencies that 
are associated with enzyme classification tasks.

# CNN Model

Embeddings type incorporated is taken care of under the designed CNN models.
ESM2 embeddings need the first layer, with output channels 4 and a kernel size of 61, to be a 1D convolution suitable for particular sequential data processing.
It is then followed by a series of 2D convolutional layers, increasing in model complexity and depth, specifically designed to capture spatial hierarchies in the data.
The architecture concludes the fully connected layer transmogrifying the output of the convolutional layer to the final classification output having 7 units.

The fully connected architecture all along relies on 2D convolutions for PROTT5 embeddings, pointing to a change to the different texture 
of PROTT5 embeddings with respect to ESM2.
It is concluded by a fully connected output layer mapping the VGG-like TODO: What is that?
architecture of the extracted features onto the classification labels in a manner paralleled to the ESM2.

# LSTM Model TODO: Ich würde das sogar raus lassen weil es hat ja dann nicht funktioniert

The LSTM model, although only implemented in a partially fully realized capacity due to memory constraints and thereby extended 
processing times, represents an audacious attempt at utilizing the power of reoccurring neural networks for enzyme classification.
These are the characteristics that best fit the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layers for sequence data, such enzymes 
of which given the capability to hold long-term dependencies and thus very crucial in order to comprehend the sequential nature of the proteins in this content selected.

# Conclusion

In summary, each model reflects a thoughtful and nuanced approach to the complex task of enzyme classification. 
While the models are promising, future directions include architecture optimization for different embeddings and especially improvement of both accuracy 
and computational efficiency for LSTM model.
